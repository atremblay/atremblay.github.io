I love the unknown and thrive on uncertainty. A hollistic view of machine learning allows me to take an idea and grow it from protytpe to production. During the past 5 years I built and lead a team of DataOps, MLOps and Research at Explorance where we developped a first-of-its-kind product allowing deeper insights into open text feedback. Experienced Head of Machine Learning with a track record of leading innovative ML strategies and managing cross-functional teams. Passionate about building a new team of engineers and researchers from scratch, fostering innovation, and delivering cutting-edge AI solutions. Committed to staying ahead of industry advancements and ensuring organizational growth and success.
